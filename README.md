## 📌 Overview
PneumoSight is an Artificial Intelligence based system that proposes a solution for the early detection of pneumonia using Chest X-Ray images. This AI system based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to automatically classify lung X-ray images into Normal and Pneumonia categories as an early diagnostic support tool for healthcare professionals.

## ✨ Features
- Automatic classification of Chest X-Ray images into Normal and Pneumonia categories
- Display of classification accuracy percentage to represent model performance

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
Frontend
- React

Backend
- Python
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- TensorFlow & Keras — loading and running the AI model
- NumPy & OpenCV — image preprocessing

AI Training
- NumPy, Pandas — data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib, Seaborn — training data visualization
- Scikit-learn — dataset splitting and model evaluation
- TensorFlow & Keras — CNN model training
- OpenCV — image preprocessing and data augmentation
